stuff todo
===============

- add more data
rock strata, hot springs, ores, etc.
these are all publicly available datasets that could be used by the mod.
perhaps some integration with the biomes mod would be cool as well: https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/mod/8785
there is ALOT of data that can be used. much more than i mentioned here.

- allow any map size generation
vs region size is 512, i only take in a map size that is divisble by this for simplicity.
this would be straightforward to implement, we just divide the map into its divisible sections,
then when that generation is complete, we can generate the excess on the edges.

- generate map in parts
add a way to generate very large maps in multiple parts. or if a generation crashes,
we can safely return to where we stopped and continue generation.

- fix lag spikes when generating near worldborder
might be issue with vs, console gets spammed and the game bricks sometimes.
very annoying


long term
===============

- publish pre-genned maps on a website
hosting some free example maps for people to try out would be nice. 

- integrate bmp creation/map creation
add some seamless way to generate a map with one command.
we can generate the bmps, boot up a vs server with the mod in docker,
then run generation, and provide output vs world to user.

- docker? gui?
make it easy for windows plebs to use this

- vs-worldpainter
lol
vs fantasy mmo server?!
